An API server for geographic data.

To build production, type `make prod`.

To create the env for a new developer, run `make dev_env`.

## Ideas
The following is a list of ideas involving geographic data we could implement:
- Natural Disasters ([earthquakes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/warcoder/earthquake-dataset), [tsunamis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/tsunami-dataset))
- Airplane crashes ([dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908))
- Corporate Headquarters ([dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mannmann2/fortune-500-corporate-headquarters))
