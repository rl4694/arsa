Current Objectives:
[x] Decide on a geographical topic to focus on, then brainstorm general concept and additional requirements on top of the assignment objectives
[ ] Once the features have been planned out, assign tasks to each member on the parts they are responsible for, make sure we can deliver a continuously working product as we iterate on gradually adding features.

Milestones:
[x] 10/14 Github Actions Working
[ ] 10/30 Incorporate the use of fixtures (reusable predefinied setup code for tests)
[ ] 10/30 Incorporate the use of raises (gracefully fail on bad inputs)
[ ] 10/30 Incorporate the use of skips (conditionally skip tests)
[ ] 10/30 Incorporate the use of patch (mock/replace functions for testing)
[ ] 11/13 Make sure the code is able to run with a local MongoDB server
[ ] 11/26 Make sure the code is able to run with a cloud based MongoDB server
[ ] 12/04 Deploy the API server on the cloud

(More milestones as features are agreed upon and fleshed out)
