Large mud puddles gathered at the road’s edge with cars having to manoeuvre around the mud and a large boulder blocking the north-bound lane entirely.  Old Howick Road resident Cheryl Dunnington said she had heard rushing water at around 8 am on Monday and when she went to investigate, she found the bank nearest the Hilton-bound lane had collapsed into the road.  She said she had been calling the municipality since the bank collapsed but found it difficult to get through to anyone. “I eventually called the police and they sent someone to direct the traffic.”  She said the water had pushed not only large amounts of mud into the road, but also a few rocks and a boulder.","Old Howick Road, Hilton, South Africa",5km,mudslide,leaking_pipe,small,above_road,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,07/11/2017 02:24:00 PM,11/20/2017 03:17:00 PM,02/15/2018 03:51:00 PM,30.280797,-29.542639

The beach remains open but visitors can park at the Longbow Archery Trail or the boat launch and walk 1.5 miles to the beach area. Boaters can still access from Lake Vesuvius.  “This landslide hit exactly where last year’s July windstorm caused a blowdown on the beach road”, says Ironton District Ranger Tim Slone. The slide is located 100-feet from the east end of the beach and is also blocking the Lakeshore Hiking Trail. “We’ve already re-located the Lakeshore Trail around the slide.

The landslide hit the village of Guanshan at Friday dawn after torrential rains, estimated to be the heaviest to hit the area in 300 years, pounded the city of Linxiang in Hunan Province for about six hours, according to the results of an official probe.  The results said that the region's recent severe drought made the ground more dry than usual, allowing the heavy rains to sweep away sand and rocks. This resulted in a landslide that roared down a mountain slope 300 meters above Guanshan.  The probe, conducted by a panel of experts in the wake of the disaster, found that there were no illegal mines or breached reservoirs in the area where the landslide occurred, effectively ruling out any man-made causes.  ----- Photo taken on June 10, 2011 shows a site of the landslide at "," Maojiazu(?) subvillage, Guanshan village(?), near Yunshan(Dayunshan) National Forest Park, Zhanqiao township, Linxiang district, Yueyang city, Hunan",25km,landslide,downpour,large,unknown,20,,,,,glc,3588,China,CN,Hubei,0,Beigang,8.9355,04/01/2014 12:00:00 AM,11/20/2017 03:17:00 PM,02/15/2018 03:51:00 PM,113.5578,29.3046
