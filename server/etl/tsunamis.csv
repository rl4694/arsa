<P>During the earthquake, the sky in the direction from Dalmatia to Istria assumed a bright flame - like red color, long flame - colored stripes appeared. The sea overflowed its shores, with the result that buildings were destroyed and lives were lost.

was introduced into the literature by one of the medieval chroniclers in 1596 to explain why the city walls collapsed in Verona. In the paper, a proposal was made that the tsunami was possibly caused by the February, 792 earthquake

<P>This event is well documented by contemporary authors, including Seneca, who confirms that it happened in his own time and during the consulship of Valerius Asiaticus (AD 46). Dio Cassius dates it Roman year 800 (AD 47), while St Jerome gives the fifth year of Olympiad CCVI (AD 45), and notes the length of the island as 30 stadia (5.5 km). Orosius (writing early in the fifth century AD) dates it to the fifth year of Claudius (AD 45-46).
<P>Since Aurelis Victor mentions that it happened on the same night as a lunar eclipse, there is a chance of dating the eruption accurately. Schove and Fletcher (1987, 9-11) derive several dates, noting that the most popular is 31 December AD 46, because this would embrace both Seneca's date of AD 46 and Dio's of AD 47. However, he thinks that 6 July AD 46 is more probable because the eclipse would have been distinctly noticeable by about 8.53 pm, and consequently more likely to be recorded.
<P>One must beware of confusing this eruption with that of Hiera in 199-198 BC, since the two occurrences were very similar in nature. Pliny mentions both, but the dates in the relevant passage are notoriously unreliable. Pliny's date, 8 July of the 110th year after the fourth year of Olympiad CXLV, works out as AD 3. This is due in part to a scribal error in an early copy of Pliny's works, when many events were assigned to Olympiad CXXXV.
<P>Modern cataloguers associated this eruption with the Crete earthquake of 62-64, dating it 53/52/66. Guidoboni (1989, 661-662), Guidoboni et al. (1994, 193-194) associate this eruption at Thera with the Crete earthquake of 62-64, dating it 53/52/66 for which I have no evidence.

The ship was torn from its anchors and damaged (Repetti, 1946; Iida et al., 1967; Cox,1970).

<P><blockquote><i>Reference #3029:</i></blockquote> 
<P>1653, July. Island of Mindoro. Midnight. The Recoleto historian, Father Diego de Santa Teresa, reports an earthquake as follows: ""[The galleon San Francisco Xavier] reached the strait of San Bernardino after a successful voyage, and, passing through it at the risk occasioned by the vicinity of so many islands, anchored near Mindoro. At midnight it was in great danger because an earthquake caused the sea to throw up breaking waves, and the galleon broke from its anchors. It would have been carried to certain destruction if it had not been saved by the Suffering Christ."" DST, p. 243. We learn from the Augustinian historian, Diaz, that the ship entered San Bernardino on June 26 and arrived at Cavite on July 23. He mentions that it was nearly wrecked in a storm off Mindoro and encountered three more typhoons before reaching Manila.
He makes no mention of an earthquake. CD, pp. 527-528. The reality of this earthquake may be reasonably doubted. In order to have the effects on the sea which Santa Teresa describes, the earthquake would have been very strong and could scarcely have escaped notice by other historians."

which occurred in Constantinople on April 1646. As a result of the shock 136 ships, we are informed, were thrown on land. This event we also find in Huot (1837) who adds that the earthquake shock itself was not severe. Nevertheless, the sea rushed inland so violently that 136 sailing ships were cast on shore. The original source of information seems to be a letter of Dr. Vivoli, to which unfortunately have not had access. It is quite clear that what Huot describes is the result of a seismic sea-wave which it is of interest to notice that in this case was caused by a rather mild shock.
<P>From Mallet (1858) we learn that on April 5, 1646, an earthquake occurred also in Italy. Magri (1647) says that this earthquake caused much damage in Livorno where sea-waves damaged the ships at anchor in the harbour of the town. Mallet regards these two earthquakes to have occurred simultaneously on the 5th of April 1646. On the basis of the available information on these two events it is difficult to appreciate this coincidence. If Mallets view was correct, it is difficult to distinguish whether the event of April in Constantinople was the result of a strong sea-wave which was set up by the Livorno earthquake or of a local seismic sea-wave.

<P>August 1, 1629, 21:30 [local time]. Validity 3. The Banda Islands felt  a strong earthquake; the ground cracked. Half an hour later, a high mountain of water appeared in the strait between Lonthor and Neira Islands. The tidal wave rolled directly onto Fort Nassau and the coastal settlement of Bandaneira on Neira Island. The water rose 16 m (9 fathoms) above the spring flood tide mark (according to Perrey, the water inundated Fort Nassau by 3 m [9 feet]). The stone breakwater in front of the fortress was washed away. The water invaded the fort with such force that a cannon weighing 1 1/2 tons was dragged 11 m. Several homes on the shore were washed away, and others were destroyed. The wave rose three times and spun the ""Brill,"" which was riding at anchor in the roadstead, though the ship was not damaged. Many fish were tossed up on shore. 
<P>In the eastern direction, the tidal waves surged onto the coast of Lonthor Island, where a stone breakwater was also washed away.
