<P>During the earthquake, the sky in the direction from Dalmatia to Istria assumed a bright flame - like red color, long flame - colored stripes appeared. The sea overflowed its shores, with the result that buildings were destroyed and lives were lost.

was introduced into the literature by one of the medieval chroniclers in 1596 to explain why the city walls collapsed in Verona. In the paper, a proposal was made that the tsunami was possibly caused by the February, 792 earthquake

Orosius (writing early in the fifth century AD) dates it to the fifth year of Claudius (AD 45-46).
<P>Since Aurelis Victor mentions that it happened on the same night as a lunar eclipse, there is a chance of dating the eruption accurately. Schove and Fletcher (1987, 9-11) derive several dates, noting that the most popular is 31 December AD 46, because this would embrace both Seneca's date of AD 46 and Dio's of AD 47. However, he thinks that 6 July AD 46 is more probable because the eclipse would have been distinctly noticeable by about 8.53 pm, and consequently more likely to be recorded.
<P>One must beware of confusing this eruption with that of Hiera in 199-198 BC, since the two occurrences were very similar in nature. Pliny mentions both, but the dates in the relevant passage are notoriously unreliable. Pliny's date, 8 July of the 110th year after the fourth year of Olympiad CXLV, works out as AD 3. This is due in part to a scribal error in an early copy of Pliny's works, when many events were assigned to Olympiad CXXXV.
<P>Modern cataloguers associated this eruption with the Crete earthquake of 62-64, dating it 53/52/66. Guidoboni (1989, 661-662), Guidoboni et al. (1994, 193-194) associate this eruption at Thera with the Crete earthquake of 62-64, dating it 53/52/66 for which I have no evidence.

The ship was torn from its anchors and damaged (Repetti, 1946; Iida et al., 1967; Cox,1970).

<P>1653, July. Island of Mindoro. Midnight. The Recoleto historian, Father Diego de Santa Teresa, reports an earthquake as follows: ""[The galleon San Francisco Xavier] reached the strait of San Bernardino after a successful voyage, and, passing through it at the risk occasioned by the vicinity of so many islands, anchored near Mindoro. At midnight it was in great danger because an earthquake caused the sea to throw up breaking waves, and the galleon broke from its anchors. It would have been carried to certain destruction if it had not been saved by the Suffering Christ."" DST, p. 243. We learn from the Augustinian historian, Diaz, that the ship entered San Bernardino on June 26 and arrived at Cavite on July 23. He mentions that it was nearly wrecked in a storm off Mindoro and encountered three more typhoons before reaching Manila.
He makes no mention of an earthquake. CD, pp. 527-528. The reality of this earthquake may be reasonably doubted. In order to have the effects on the sea which Santa Teresa describes, the earthquake would have been very strong and could scarcely have escaped notice by other historians."

The original source of information seems to be a letter of Dr. Vivoli, to which unfortunately have not had access. It is quite clear that what Huot describes is the result of a seismic sea-wave which it is of interest to notice that in this case was caused by a rather mild shock.
<P>From Mallet (1858) we learn that on April 5, 1646, an earthquake occurred also in Italy. Magri (1647) says that this earthquake caused much damage in Livorno where sea-waves damaged the ships at anchor in the harbour of the town. Mallet regards these two earthquakes to have occurred simultaneously on the 5th of April 1646. On the basis of the available information on these two events it is difficult to appreciate this coincidence. If Mallets view was correct, it is difficult to distinguish whether the event of April in Constantinople was the result of a strong sea-wave which was set up by the Livorno earthquake or of a local seismic sea-wave.

Ogerius Panis and Marchisius Scriba as well as Oliverus
Scholasticus record a strong earthquake in Cyprus on May
1222, which did much damage at Lemessos, Nicosia and elsewhere. ..during this earthquake:
... the sea abandoned its habitual places and retreated
far into the open sea. Baffa (Paphos) and Limisso (Lemessos)
were then submerged by the sea ... and  ... the
harbour (of Paphos) dried up, and then the town was
submerged by the sea...
<P>
There is no doubt that this event occurred on
May 1222 AD. In all earthquake catalogues this Cyprian earthquake is dated December 25, 1222. The reason for this is that many Latin chronographers considered the shaking of Cyprus as result of the great Lombardian earthquake of 25 December 1222 which shook also Tyrol, and southern Germany and which was followed by many aftershocks till January 11, 1223. This, once more, shows how misleading was the tendency of early chroniclers to treat collectively different earthquakes.

were also destroyed; <B>four people died</B> in the debris. The other homes cracked. Cracks two fingers or more across appeared in the ground at many places. A mud flow burst from Mount Ratu Elera east of the city. The walls of buildings were damaged at Hila as well as at Hitulama, on the north coast. At Hutumuri, on the eastern coast of the island, a tidal wave followed a strong earthquake.
On Haruku Island, water gushed up at many places and some walls of buildings collapsed. The earthquake was followed by a tsunami, which however, soon stopped. On Saparua Island, the earthquake did not do substantial damage
to structures. A tidal wave was also noticed here. An earthquake was felt on Manipa Island.

This earthquake affected a large area in southwest Turkey and the Dodecanese Islands. Damage extended from the island of Cos and Rhodes to the Gulf of Antalya and to Cine in the north, an area of radius 90 km... Rhodes was ruined by the earthquake and the sea drew back, leaving the harbour dry... Aristides would seem to be writing about the second event [141 and 142]: he describes a seismic sea wave that destroyed Rhodes and left it ruined. This would tally with Pausania's second account, where he mentions that the cities of Rhodes were rebuilt by the emperor. (ref #9116)
<P>142 (148). Island of Rhodes. The town of Rhodes was destroyed by an earthquake, and its ruins were washed away by the wave that rushed in so quickly that the citizens suffering the earthquake had no time to find their relatives; the sea water penetrated deep into dry land for several miles. The towns on the islands of Kos, Symi, Serifos suffered from the earthquake and tsunami (ref # 2130)
<P>142. If we can trust Aristides's account, the city of Rhodes was practically devastated not so much by the earthquake as by the sea-wave which followed. Towns in the islands of Cos, Seriphos and Syme suffered heavily from both the earthquake shock and the ensued sea-wave. In Rhodes the sea advanced many miles inland and rased to the ground what ruins were left standing by the shock proper. (reference #23)

Many coeval sources report detailed description of the earthquake but only one refers that the shock was followed by a seismic sea wave.

In the rhetorical speech Rodiakos of Aristides Aelius (129189 AD), communicated to the citizens of Rhodes, a strong tsunami caused by the earthquake is described (see passages 2026): <i>. . . and I remember that in that fatal noon, when the calamity that happened to you started, when the sea was calm,. . . and all the earthquake force was directed against the city. . . Then the sea water retreated and the ports dried up. . . and the ports became as the dry ground. . . And everything happened at the same moment: the earthquake of the sea, the clouds, the roaring, the lamentations, the noise of the dead bodies, the ground subsidence. . . Everything had collapsed. . . . </i> In addition, the speech of Aelius makes clear that the islands of Symi (Dodecanese) and Serifos (Cyclades) were not destructed by the earthquake as claimed by Papazachos and Papazachou (1997) who apparently misunderstood passage 38 of the speech. The estimates for the year of occurrence of this earthquake and tsunami event range about seven years around 148. Papachristodoulou (1994) prefers to call it the large shock of the middle of 2nd century AD. (reference #2840)"

An earthquake felt in Crete was associated with an abnormal fluctuation of sea level. Apollonius, an eyewitness to the event, relates that, about midday, an earthquake shook the whole island and that at Leben, on the south coast of the island, south of Gortyna, the sea receded about 7 stadia (1.3km). He adds that travelers arriving from Cydoniatis (modern Chania) in the western part of the island reported that at the same time an island rose out of the sea between Thera and Crete.
<P>The date of the event is not given, but Apollonius was in Sparta until the end of the winter of AD 61 and in the spring of the following year, AD 62, he proceeded to Crete. Although it is not known how long he stayed on the island, he arrived in Rome early in AD 64 or possibly, at the latest, in AD 66. There is no literary evidence that the shock caused any damage on the island; had it been serious, it would have been mentioned by Apollonius.
<P>Archaeological evidence suggests some destruction at Gortya but this is dated vaguely to the period of Nero or Flavius (Di Vita 1986).

Some recent historical, archaeological and seismological studies tend to date it to 62 or 66 AD. Strong earthquake affecting Crete accompanied by a sea withdrawal. At Leben, southern Crete,  the sea withdrew for about one mile. (reference #4139)
<P>62 A.D. (possibly 46 or 66). Eruption of the volcano of Santorini was accompanied by an earthquake felt strongly on the Island of Crete. The sea in Lebena on the southern coast of Crete retreated approximately 100 m from the waterline.(Ref #2130)

There remains, however, to identify the island alluded to by Apollonius, which should have been connected with the sea-wave at Leben. For this, we resort to Bursian (1862, p. 522) who very logically
suggests that there might have been a volcanic shoal or islet near Thera (Santorini) which following the behaviour not so uncommon with islets around Thera, sunk shortly after it emerged from the sea. As for the origin of the seismic sea-wave observed at Leben, we may say that is was of volcanic nature. (reference #23)

It has been described by Fr. Buencuchillo, 0.S.A., an eye-witness, since he was at the
time parish-priest of Sala. During the night of that day the top of the mountain burst out with tremendous force from the same crater which since ancient times used to emit fire and rocks. The course of events was this: <P>
...I noticed that also from the water there arose enormous columns of sand and ashes, which ascended in the shape of pyramids to marvelous heights and then fell back into the lake like illuminated fountains.<P>Some of the pyramids surged toward north, others toward east, the sight lasting until 9 o'clock of the morning. At the latter hour there was felt a furious earthquake which left nothing moveable in
its place within the convento. This forced me to flee to higher ground, especially as I noticed that some of the horrid pyramids shooting forth from the water were coming toward the town and place where we were. When they reached that part of the lake's shore which was known as ""tierra destruida"" [waste land?], they ruined that tract entirely, and with a second earthquake, not less fierce than the one
shortly preceding, it sank into the lake. To this very day, the branches of the trees buried beneath the water can be seen from the distance. <P>During these terrible convulsions of the earth fissures opened in the ground amid horrifying roars, said fissures extending from the northern and northeastern beach of the lake as far as the neighborhood of the town of Calamba. Here as well as elsewhere, the whole shore of Lake Bombon has been disturbed. The entire territory of Sala and part of that of Tanauan have been rendered practically uninhabitable-the water courses have been altered, former springs have ceased to flow and new ones made their appearance, the whole country is traversed by fissures, and extensive subsidences have occurred in many places. <P>Sala and its surroundings to the northeast of the lake, as well as, a portion of the territory of Tanauan, which is north of it, were so thoroughly ruined and, consequently, depopulated that within the same year, 1749, the former was united with the latter town.
<P>(above from reference #2340)
<P>[...]the origin of the waves observed during the 1749 eruption remains unclear. This violent phreatomagmatic eruption (VEI 4) lasted three months and severely impacted the northern and northeastern shores of the lake (Delos Reyes et al. 2018). One earthquake led to land subsidence in the northeastern part of the caldera (near Tanauan). Explosions were located in the main crater of Taal Island (Fig. 1), with a possible extension to coastal or sublacustrine vents near the northeastern point of the island. (reference#12533)"

Many parts of Saint Minas, the tower bell of Sotiros and the wall of Saint Paraskeve were fissured. Large damage occurred in the capital Amaxike. As it results from a memorial tablet in the wall of the Latin church Pantokrator, which was located in the fortress of Leukada and was built by Varbarigo Balbo in 1733, this church was pulled down by the earthquake. In the same note of Kontarini, it is written that at 2h in the night an earthquake occurred and it was near to destroy all houses in Lixuri. The sea rushed in the land and then withdrew.

A great number of detonations were heard in the air, and shortly after it became plain that the volcano in Lake Bombon had burst on its southeastern side, which faces Lipa, so that the whole point called Calauit appeared to be on fire. Later on the eruption seemed to spread into the lake, in the direction of Mount Macolod, which rises opposite the volcano on the southeastern shore of the lake. Great masses of smoke, water, and ashes rushed out of the lake, high up into the air, looking like towers.  Simultaneously there was a great commotion in the earth which stirred up the water in the lake, forming immense waves which lashed the shores as though a violent typhoon were raging. Their fury was such that in front of the Convento of Taal, and in other places of the beach, a strip of more than 10 brazas [16.7 meters] in width was engulfed by the water, and the church was endangered. On the following days, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, things continued in the same way, but by Sunday all the combustible material appears to have been consumed. This eruption killed all the fishes, large and small, the waves casting them ashore in a state as if they had been cooked, since the water had been heated to a degree that it appeared to have been taken from a boiling caldron. There was an all-pervading, pestilential stench of sulphur which greatly molested the inhabitants of the towns surrounding the lake. Sunday morning the sun broke through, but later torrential rains fell with thunder and lightning, some of the latter striking and the whole causing the greatest terror. Finally, however, the weather cleared, and of the whole tragedy there remained no other signs than the stench of sulphur and of the great quantity of dead fish cast upon the beach by the waves.

Trees and bushes were uprooted and carried away by the water. The wave loosened the anchors of ships lying in the harbour.

<P>April 6, 1580, English Channel: Epicenter, probably submarine, near the east coast of Kent. Sandwich (51 deg 16 min N., 01 deg 21 min E) and Dover (51 deg 08 min N, 01 deg 18 min E) -- Sea much agitated, Vessels in the harbor were dashed together. (reference #43)
<P>Effects on water were noticeable, especially since all accounts agree that at the time of the earthquake the weather was fine and calm. The agitation of the Thames is reported by Churchyard (1580) and others. In the English Channel, it was worse. At Sandwich, ""the sea so foamed, that the ships tottered"" (Stow, 1601). One contemporary account suggests that marine effects were more severe on the other side of the Channel. ""In Calais .. . there was such a horrible and fearful trembling that a great part of the houses collapsed and even the sea flooded into the town . .. In Boulogne there was a similar earthquake and flooding by the sea"" (Discours d'une ... , 1580). This may be a seismic sea-wave, but unfortunately there is some doubt about the time, and therefore about the actual relationship between earthquake and marine incursion. Elsewhere in the same document we find it stated that on the 7th April between 4 and 5 a.m. (which coincidentally is the time of the third Kent aftershock) ""there occurred in these places great signs of floods"". (reference #3945)
<P>Varley (1996) states categorically that the earthquake produced a tsunami (which he refers to as a tidal wave) at Calais, Boulogne and Dover. Neilson et al (1984) are more cautious, considering that due to uncertainty about the coincidence in time of inundation and earthquake, the flooding report may have had some other cause (presumably meteorological). Melville et al (1996) are dismissive of the idea of a tsunami from this event. Evidence suggests (Melville et al 1996) that contemporary sources conflated descriptions of the earthquake with the effects of a storm that occurred very shortly afterwards. This is all the more likely since at this period it was not known that earthquakes were very short-lived phenomena, and to a 16th century writer it would have been natural to consider the seismic shock and a storm a day later as being part of the same occurrence. Undoubtedly the earthquake caused agitation of the water in harbours at Dover and Sandwich harbours (Neilson et al 1984). It is most likely that this movement was a seiche and not a tsunami as there is no evidence of any seabed displacement in the area and the strength of the earthquake (5.8 ML (Musson, 1994)) was insufficient to cause a tsunami directly.

<P>OLoughlin and Lander (2003) resenan un tsunami dudoso en Cumana, península de Araya y Cubagua. Vila (1948) afirma que no existio tal evento en 1543 y que el equivoco se fundamenta en la relacion hecha por el cronista Juan de Castellanos, quien llego a Cubagua en el ano 1541, justo a tiempo para ser testigo de la tormenta ocurrida el día de navidad, cuya memoria pondria por escrito en 1589, confundiendo, no solo las fechas sino también los hechos. El relato que finalmente consigna Castellanos, ha sido erroneamente interpretado como un sismo tsunamigenico que ocasiono la destruccion de Nueva Cadiz en 1543 (Castellanos, 1851). Asi mismo, Grases et al. (1999) descartan la ocurrencia de dicho evento y senalan: La tesis de la destruccion por causa de un huracán parece la más pausible, dada la ubicacion de la isla de Cubagua en un area que se encuentra en la ruta que han seguido fenomenos atmosféricos de la misma naturaleza. Cabe destacar que la busqueda en fuentes primarias no ha arrojado ningun resultado sobre este supuesto terremoto tsunamigenico. [Similarly, Grases et al (1999) discards the occurence of the event and states: The thesis that the destruction was caused by a hurricane seems most plausible, given the location of the island of Cubagua in an área found on the path followed by atmospheric phenomena. Should also be mentioned that in searching primary sources not a single result has been found to indicate the possibility of this supposed tsunamigenic earthquake.]  (reference #11659)"
